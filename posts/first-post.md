Law school is demanding. The long hours of study, the pressure to perform, and the competitive environment can take a toll on your mental and physical health. That's why self-care isn't a luxuryâ€”it's a necessity.

Here are a few tips to help you stay well:
- **Schedule Breaks:** Just as you schedule time for studying, schedule time for rest.
- **Stay Active:** Physical activity is a powerful stress reliever.
- **Connect with Others:** Don't isolate yourself. Spend time with friends and family.
